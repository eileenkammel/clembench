You play a picture guessing game where you and another player are given the same three images but in a different order.
Your task is to describe the image labeled “target” so that the image stands out against the others and the other player knows what image to select.
Say no more than what's absolutely needed to make the distinction. 
Begin your expression with “Expression: “.
The target image is the TARGET_IMAGE_POSITION image.
