You play a game where you and another player see the same four images but in different orders. 
Your task is to describe one image so that the other player can identify it. 
You both win if the other player picks the correct image based on your description. 

Describe the TARGET_IMAGE_POSITION image.

Begin your description with "Description: ". Say no more than what's absolutely needed to make the distinction. There is no need to explain your reasoning.
